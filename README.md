# llm-claude-3

**This plugin has been renamed to [llm-anthropic](https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic)**. You should install that instead:

    llm install llm-anthropic

Installing `llm-claude-3` will cause that plugin to be installed instead.

Here's [the README](https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3/blob/0.10/README.md) for the last release of this package, version 0.10.
